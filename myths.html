            <h4>MYTHS AND FACTS
              <img>
            </h4>
            <br><br><br><br>
            <hr>
            
                
               <p class="pmyth"> Myth 2:
                
                People receiving packages from China are at high risk of acquiring the coronavirus.</p>
                
                <p>Fact:
                
                No, coronaviruses do not sustain on objects for a long period of time</p>
                <br>
              <p class="pmyth">  Myth 3:
                
                Antibiotics can help alleviate symptoms of coronavirus.</p>
                
               <p> Fact:
                
                Not true. Antibiotics are only effective against bacterial infections</p>
                <br>
               <p class="pmyth"> Myth 4:
                
                A pneumonia vaccine could protect against coronavirus infection.</p>
                
              <p>  Fact:
                
                No. Research is ongoing</p>
                <br>
               <p class="pmyth"> Myth 5:
                
                Eating garlic guarantees the coronavirus cannot affect the body.</p>
                
                <p>
                Fact :

                No doubt that garlic is a powerhouse of natural antioxidants, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial compounds, which bolster immunity and shield the human system from infection against common bacteria and viruses. However, there is no evidence to suggest it is a definitive preventive food to avoid coronavirus infection.</p>
                <br>
               <p class="pmyth"> Myth: 6
                Are pregnant women at risk of acquiring coronavirus disease?</p>
                
               <p> Fact:
                
                Yes, the immunity of a pregnant woman is generally low, so expectant mothers should follow proper hygiene and stay away from exposure to any sort of germs.</p>           
                <br>     
               <p class="pmyth"> Myth 7:
                
                Can Covid-19 spread through drinking water?</p>
                
               <p> Fact:
                
                No, water treatment methods ensure the elimination of all viruses including COVID-19</p>
                <br>
                <p class="pmyth">   Myth 8:
                
                The coronavirus disease does not spread in regions with warm, humid climates.</p>
                
               <p> Fact:
                
                This is not true. COVID-19, the deadly disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, a novel strain of coronavirus, can, in fact, be rapidly transmitted in all places across the world, in all climatic conditions, be it summer, winter, spring, autumn or monsoons.</p>
                <br>
               <p class="pmyth"> Myth 9:
                
                COVID-19 can be transmitted through mosquito bites.</p>
                
              <p>  Fact:
                
                There is neither any scientific evidence nor a single instance in COVID-19 affected patients, wherein the coronavirus disease has been transmitted by means of mosquito bites.</p>
                <br>
               <p class="pmyth"> Myth 10:
                
                Taking a bath in hot water every day will protect people from COVID-19</p>
                
                <p>Fact:No. Showering in warm water does not ensure complete prevention of coronavirus disease. The best way to shield the body from COVID-19 infection is by practicing social distancing, staying at home, regularly washing hands and disinfecting frequently used surfaces and objects in the house.</p>
                <p class="pmyth"> Myth 11:
                  Will most people who get COVID-19 get very sick or die?
                  </p>
                  <p>Fact :
                    Most people who get COVID-19 will have a mild form of the illness and will be able to recover at home, without needing hospital treatment. Stay home and call your local health authority for advice if you have any symptoms of COVID-19. If you have difficulty breathing, persistent pain in your chest or loss of speech or mobility, call your health provider straight away.
                  </p>
                  <p class="pmyth">
                    Myth 12:
                    Can you always tell if someone has COVID-19?
                  </p>
                  <p>Fact :
                    No. The virus that causes COVID-19 can be in someone’s body for up to 14 days before they get symptoms, and some people will have such a mild case of COVID-19 that they might not have any symptoms.

                    You can still pass COVID-19 on, even if you don’t have any symptoms. That’s why it is important that everyone follows the prevention advice – such social distancing, wearing a face mask and regularly washing their hands – even if they feel healthy.
                    </p>
                    <p class="pmyth">
                      Myth 13:
                      Who’s at risk? ,
Does COVID-19 only affect rich people?
</p>
                    <p>Fact :
                      Anyone can get COVID-19, regardless of how much money they have. COVID-19 has affected people from all over the world, including people of all backgrounds, races, ages and financial statuses.
                    </p>
                    <p class="pmyth">
                      Does COVID-19 only affect old people, meaning young people don’t have to worry?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Fact :
                      While COVID-19 can be more dangerous in older people, anyone can get it including young people, some of whom become seriously ill. While we don’t yet fully understand why some people get more serious symptoms, we do know that young people are more likely to develop serious symptoms if they have certain underlying health conditions, including obesity, diabetes, cancer or high blood pressure.
                    </p>
                    <p class="pmyth">
                      Myth 14:
                      Are people living with HIV more likely to get seriously ill ?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Fact :
                      We are still learning about the risk of developing severe COVID-19 for people living with HIV. Current evidence suggests that people living with HIV have a higher risk, but less so than other health conditions, including obesity, diabetes, severe asthma, heart or lung problems, stroke, dementia or older age.
                    </p>
                    <p class="pmyth">
                      Myth 15:
                      Can hot drinks stop COVID-19?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Fact :
                      There is no drink, hot or cold, that will protect you from coronavirus or cure the illness. Most people who get COVID-19 recover by themselves. Taking paracetamol, drinking lots of liquids, and getting enough rest can help you manage your symptoms.
                    </p>
                    <p class="pmyth">
                      Myth 16 :
                      Should I use a strong disinfectant to clean my hands and body to protect myself from COVID-19
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Fact :
                      You shouldn’t use strong disinfectant to clean your body. Washing your hands thoroughly with soap and water or rubbing an alcohol-based sanitizer on them will stop the virus from being passed on. Using stronger chemicals on your skin can be dangerous. Never drink disinfectant or hand sanitizer as this can do serious damage.
                    </p>
                    <p class="pmyth">
                      Myth 17 :
                      Can drinking alcohol cure or prevent COVID-19?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Fact :
                      Drinking alcohol doesn’t cure or prevent COVID-19. In fact, drinking alcohol can weaken your immune system. It’s recommended that adults limit their alcohol intake to stay healthy
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Fact :
                      FACT: People should NOT wear masks while exercising 

                      People should NOT wear masks when exercising, as masks may reduce the ability to breathe comfortably.
                      
                      Sweat can make the mask become wet more quickly which makes it difficult to breathe and promotes the growth of microorganisms. The important preventive measure during exercise is to maintain physical distance of at least one meter from others.
