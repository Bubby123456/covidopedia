<br>
•When caregiver entering the room, both caregiver and patient may consider using N 95 mask.
<br>
•Mask should be discarded only after disinfecting it with 1 per cent sodium hypochlorite.
<br>
•Take rest and drink a lot of fluids to maintain adequate hydration.
<br>
•Follow respiratory etiquette all the time.
<br>
•Don’t share personal items with other people.
<br>
•Frequent handwashing with soap and water for at least 40 seconds or clean with alcohol-based sanitiser.
<br>
•Ensure cleaning of surfaces in the room that are touched often with 1% hypochlorite solution.
<br>
•Self-monitoring of blood oxygen saturation with a pulse oximeter is strongly advised.

                        •This is a simple and effective test to measure how healthy your lungs and heart are functioning. 
                        <br>
                        •It is usually suggested for COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms who are treated at home.
                        <br>
                        •The 6-minute walk test (6MWT) was established as a clinical test to determine Cardio-Pulmonary exercise tolerance
                        <br>
                        <h3>HOW TO CONDUCT THE TEST</h3>

                        •Used as a screening tool for a patient with coronavirus who don’t show hypoxia (low oxygen saturation < 94%) at rest
                        <br>
                        •To the people at high risk with comorbidities like heart disease.
                        <br>
                        •Measure your oxygen levels at rest.
                        <br>
                        •Walk for 6 minutes in your room ,with the oximeter attached to your finger.
                        <br>
                        •Note your oxygen levels during and after 6 mn walk.It can be cut short to 3 min in patients above 60 years of age.
                        <br>
                        •A drop in saturation below 93% or drop of more than 3% or feeling unwell should seek immediate medical care.
