            <h2>USAGE OF PULSEOXIMETER</h2>            
            •For women, it is advisable to remove nail polish from the fingernails before putting their fingers inside the pulse oximeter. 
                <br>
            •If your hands are cold, you should warm them by rubbing against each other. 
                <br>
            •Take a rest for a minimum of 5 minutes prior to taking a measurement. 
                <br>
            •Before taking a reading, rest your hand on your chest at heart level and hold it still.
                <br>
            •Now, switch on the pulse oximeter and place it either on the index finger or the middle finger.
                <br>
            •The displayed reading may fluctuate at the beginning, so, have patience and be stable. 
                <br>
            •It is strongly recommended to keep the pulse oximeter in place for at least a minute or longer if the reading is constantly fluctuating.
                <br>
            •Note the result that is highest once it remains constant for five seconds.
                <br>
            •Record each reading with the utmost attention.
                <br>
            • Ideally, you should start tracking from the baseline and record at least 3-times a day to keep constant monitoring.
                <br>
            •The constant tracking of oxygen levels is highly important for patients suffering from the current pandemic. If the oxygen level dips below 94 percent, it is recommended that patients should immediately report to their doctor.
