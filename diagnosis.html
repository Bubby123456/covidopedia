            <h2>RAPID ANTIGEN TEST (RAT)</h2>
            •Results are available quick and fast in just 15 minutes. 
            <br>
            •Cheaper and can be done by any healthcare worker
            <br>
            •Detects viral proteins and reveals patients at the peak of the infection when the body has the highest concentration of these proteins. 
            <br>
            •During the test, any SARS-CoV-2 antigens contained in the sample react with the antibody-coated nanoparticles contained in the reactive test strip. As a result, the blend migrates chromatographically by capillary action along the reactive strip. 
            <br>
            •If the specimen contains SARS-CoV-2 antigens, these will bind to SARS-CoV-2 antibodies contained in the Test line region and generate a coloured line on the test strip, indicating a positive result. 
            <br>
            
            •Should not be used as the sole criterion for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

                <h5>REVERSE TRANSCRIPTION POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION (RTPCR)</h5>
                •Since the coronavirus is an RNA virus, a sample swab, either a nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal, must be sent to a laboratory to go through several steps to convert the RNA into viral DNA (reverse transcription).
                <br>
                •The test is very specific for the virus. If a patient tests positive, it’s highly likely that the patient has Covid-19.
                <br>
                •False-negative results – due to inadequate sampling, improper transport and late swabs the more the time gap between when the patient had symptoms and when he is tested, the more likely the test result will be false-negative.
                <br>
                •If a patient is >10 days since they have had symptoms, the false-negative rate goes way up.
                <br>
                •The deep nasopharynx swab appears to be the best location.
                <br>
                •Be aware that genetic variants of SARS-CoV-2 arise regularly and false negative test results can occur.
                <br>

• Be aware that tests that use multiple genetic targets to determine a final result are less likely to be impacted by increased prevalence of genetic variants.

                <br>
                • CORADS, stands for COVID-19 Reporting and Data System determines the level of infection and involvement. 
                <br>
                • CORAD scoring is done on the basis of 1-6, wherein 1 signifies a 'negative COVID' or normal lung function.
                <br>
                • Scores 2-4 signify suspected viral involvement and a reading of 5 means classic COVID-19.
                <br>
                • A person who has detectable ground opacities in the lungs is given a score of 6 and said to be at a higher risk of COVID severity. 
                <br>
                • A CORAD 6 score is also given to patients who test positive as per the RT-PCR report and complain of respiratory difficulties.
                <br>
                •A higher score usually represents greater lung involvement and high COVID severity.
